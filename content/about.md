Hi, I am Kai Wern.

Welcome to my blog. Here I write about
software and [life](/categories/life/). Some of the tools
I used day to day are: `vim`, `Elixir/Phoenix`, `Rust` and `PostgreSQL`.
You can expect posts about these from my blog.

I'm now into photography and drawing as well and am trying to write
more consistently.

## Now

Currently, I am attending [RC](https://www.recurse.com/). During my time here,
I'll be focusing on:

- Writing [simple database in Rust](https://github.com/kw7oe/mini-db), inspired by
[Let's Build a Simple Database](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/) tutorial.
- Writing a book about building a simple database in Rust, based on my work
above and inspired by
[Let's Build a Simple Database](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/) and
[Crafting Intepreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
- Implementing [Viewstamped Replication (VSR) in
Elixir](https://github.com/kw7oe/vsr-elixir) based on this
[paper](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf).
- Learning more about database and exploring other lower level system like networking, observability and etc.
- Publish and share more of my work publicly.

Apart from that, I have also:

- Wrote [`rok`](https://github.com/kw7oe/rok), a minimal reverse proxy inspired by [ngrok](https://ngrok.io).

## Abandoned Projects

These are some of the side projects that I worked on in the past to learn, which now has been abandoned by me:

- [TIL][1]: A Today I learned web application developed
with `Phoenix`. It includes basic features like adding post with Markdown and tagging.
The idea of the application is inspired by [Hashrocket TIL](https://til.hashrocket.com).
- [Expendere](https://expendere.herokuapp.com): A personal finance management web
application which includes features like expense tracking, budget and recurring
transaction (bills). It is developed with `Ruby on Rails` and a little bit of
`Preact`. Due to limited time _(and interest)_ available, _it is abandoned now_.
- [hbtrack](https://github.com/kw7oe/hbtrack): My first first CLI to track
habits! It's written in `Ruby` and still function well. But I stopped using it
and use Streaks instead.
