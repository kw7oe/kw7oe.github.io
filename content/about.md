Hi, I am Kai Wern.  Welcome to my blog. Here I write about
software engineering and [life](/categories/life/).

Some of the tools I used day to day are:

- vim
- Elixir/Phoenix
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- PostgreSQL

So, you can expect posts about these tools from my blog. I also like
to cook and am currently trying to write more and post consistently.

## Now

Currently, I am:

- Trying out different breakfast recipe üåÆü•™üçïüßÄüç≥ every weekend.
- Trying to publish one post per month in this blog.
- Learning C++ so I can work on the project of the [CMU CS
  14-445](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu) while following along the lectures
  in YouTube. _(Hopefully I can finish this course...)_
- Playing around with:
  - [LiveBook](https://github.com/elixir-nx/livebook)
  - [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-erlang)
  - Grafana, Loki, and Tempo
- Thinking about what's some "cool" project I can build.

## Abandoned Projects

These are some of the side projects that I worked on in the past to learn, which now has been abandoned by me:

- [TIL][1]: A Today I learned web application developed
with Phoenix. It includes basic features like adding post with Markdown and tagging.
The idea of the application is inspired by [Hashrocket TIL](https://til.hashrocket.com).
- [Expendere](https://expendere.herokuapp.com): A personal finance management web
application which includes features like expense tracking, budget and recurring
transaction (bills). It is developed with Ruby on Rails and a little bit of
Preact. Due to limited time _(and interest)_ available, _it is abandoned now_.
