Hi, I am Kai Wern.  Welcome to my blog. Here I write about
software engineering and [life](/categories/life/).

Some of the tools I used day to day are:

- vim
- Elixir/Phoenix
- Rust
- PostgreSQL

So, you can expect posts about these tools from my blog. I also like
to cook and am currently trying to write more and post consistently.

## Now

Currently, I am:

- Writing [`sqlite` in Rust](https://github.com/kw7oe/sqlite-rust), inspired by
[Let's Build a Simple Database](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/) tutorial.
- Attending [RC](https://www.recurse.com/).
- Learning more about Database System.
- Trying to workout more intensely than the past years.
- Trying to publish one post per month in this blog.
- Trying to write a book???

## Abandoned Projects

These are some of the side projects that I worked on in the past to learn, which now has been abandoned by me:

- [TIL][1]: A Today I learned web application developed
with Phoenix. It includes basic features like adding post with Markdown and tagging.
The idea of the application is inspired by [Hashrocket TIL](https://til.hashrocket.com).
- [Expendere](https://expendere.herokuapp.com): A personal finance management web
application which includes features like expense tracking, budget and recurring
transaction (bills). It is developed with Ruby on Rails and a little bit of
Preact. Due to limited time _(and interest)_ available, _it is abandoned now_.
