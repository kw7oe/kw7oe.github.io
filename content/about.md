Hi, I am Kai, a Senior Software Engineer at [Ditto][0].

## Now

Nowadays, I try to maintain a good work life balance.

## Abandoned Projects

During my time in Recurse Center, I worked on the following projects to learn about system programming:

- Writing a [simple database in Rust][4], inspired by
[Let's Build a Simple Database](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/).
- Writing [`rok`][5], a minimal reverse proxy inspired by [ngrok](https://ngrok.io).

Here's some other some projects that I worked in the past to learn:

- [TIL][1]: Today I learned a web application developed with Phoenix. It includes basic features like
adding posts with Markdown and tagging. The idea of the application is inspired by Hashrocket TIL.
- [Progressus][6]: A simple counter iOS Application.
- [hbtrack][2]: My first CLI to track habits! It’s written in Ruby and still functions well. I stopped using it,
and uses Streaks instead.
