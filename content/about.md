Hi, welcome to my blog! I am Kai Wern, a Software Engineer at [Ditto][0].

Here I write about software and life. Some of the tools I use daily
are vim, Rust, Elixir/Phoenix, and PostgreSQL. You can expect posts about these
from my blog.

Around March 2022, I attended the Spring batch of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) (RC)
During my time in here, I have work on:

- Writing [simple database in Rust][4], inspired by
[Let's Build a Simple Database](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/).
- Writing [`rok`](https://github.com/kw7oe/rok), a minimal reverse proxy inspired by [ngrok](https://ngrok.io).
- Implementing [Viewstamped Replication (VSR) in Elixir](https://github.com/kw7oe/vsr-elixir) based on this
[paper](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf).
- Learning about database and exploring other lower level system like networking, observability and etc.

## Now

I spend most of my time at work. When I'm free, I'm now making little progress on forming
some healthy habits.


## Abandoned Projects

These are the side projects that I worked in the past to learn, which now have been abandoned by me:

- [TIL][1]: Today I learned a web application developed with Phoenix. It includes basic features like
adding posts with Markdown and tagging. The idea of the application is inspired by Hashrocket TIL.
- [hbtrack][2]: My first CLI to track habits! Itâ€™s written in Ruby and still functions well. I stopped using it,
and uses Streaks instead.
