Hi, welcome to my blog! I am Kai Wern, a Software Engineer at [Ditto][0].

Here I write about software and life. Some of the tools I use daily
are vim, Rust, Elixir/Phoenix, and PostgreSQL. You can expect posts about these
from my blog.

Around March 2022, I attended the Spring batch of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) (RC)
During my time in here, I have work on:

- Writing [simple database in Rust][4], inspired by
[Let's Build a Simple Database](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/).
- Writing [`rok`](https://github.com/kw7oe/rok), a minimal reverse proxy inspired by [ngrok](https://ngrok.io).
- Implementing [Viewstamped Replication (VSR) in Elixir](https://github.com/kw7oe/vsr-elixir) based on this
[paper](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf).
- Learning about database and exploring other lower level system like networking, observability and etc.

## Now

I spend most of my time working in Ditto. After work, I'm mostly mentally exhausted 
and would just have a good rest so I can do some chores before sleep.

I'm still struggling to get back to writing, partly because my priority in life has changed 
in 2023. Until I have progress enough in the other parts of life, writing and posting 
consistently here will not be my focus.

Apart from that, I realized I have so much to learn and I would like to devote more time
learning in the next few months. Maybe I might write a little along the way, maybe not.
If you happen to read this and look forward to my writings, thanks you and stay tuned. 

I'll be back.

## Abandoned Projects

These are the side projects that I worked in the past to learn, which now have been abandoned by me:

- [TIL][1]: Today I learned a web application developed with Phoenix. It includes basic features like 
adding posts with Markdown and tagging. The idea of the application is inspired by Hashrocket TIL.
- [hbtrack][2]: My first CLI to track habits! Itâ€™s written in Ruby and still functions well. I stopped using it, 
and uses Streaks instead.
