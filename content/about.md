Hi, welcome to my blog! I am Kai Wern, a Software Engineer at Ditto.

Here I write about software and life. Some of the tools I use daily
are vim, Rust, Elixir/Phoenix, and PostgreSQL. You can expect posts about these
from my blog.

Around March 2022, I attended the Spring batch of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) (RC)
During my time in here, I have work on:

- Writing [simple database in Rust][4], inspired by
[Let's Build a Simple Database](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/).
- Writing [`rok`](https://github.com/kw7oe/rok), a minimal reverse proxy inspired by [ngrok](https://ngrok.io).
- Implementing [Viewstamped Replication (VSR) in Elixir](https://github.com/kw7oe/vsr-elixir) based on this
[paper](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf).
- Learning about database and exploring other lower level system like networking, observability and etc.

## Now

I'm almost done with dealing with personal chores in my life and starting to
get into a more stable routine. While I wish to get back into my previous
routine, I'll take my time to reflect on what's my focus in 2023.

So, stay tuned.

## Abandoned Projects

These are the side projects that I worked in the past to learn, which now have been abandoned by me:

- [TIL][1]: Today I learned a web application developed with Phoenix. It includes basic features like adding posts with Markdown and tagging. The idea of the application is inspired by Hashrocket TIL.
- [Expendere][2]: A personal finance management web application that includes features like, expense tracking, budget, and recurring transaction (bills). It is developed with Ruby on Rails and a little bit of Preact. Due to limited time (and interest) available, it is abandoned now.
- [hbtrack][3]: My first CLI to track habits! Itâ€™s written in Ruby and still functions well. But I stopped using it, and uss Streaks instead.
