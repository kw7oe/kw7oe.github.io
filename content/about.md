Hi, I am Kai Wern Choong, a software engineer at Naluri. I like to read, learn, code and cook.
Welcome to my blog. Here I write about technology and life.

Some of the technologies I used day to day are:

- vim
- Elixir
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- React
- React Native

So, you can expect posts about these technologies from my blog.

~~Lately, due to work schedule, I have not been able to write a lot. Hopefully, I
can write consistently in the coming month.~~ I have been writing a bit more
lately and manage to publish around one article per month.


## Projects

I work on some side projects to learn and solve my personal problems in my
spare time. Here are some of them:

- [TIL][1]: A Today I learned web application developed
with Phoenix. It includes basic features like adding post with Markdown and tagging.
The idea of the application is inspired by [Hashrocket TIL](https://til.hashrocket.com).
- [Expendere](https://expendere.herokuapp.com): A personal finance management web
application which includes features like expense tracking, budget and recurring
transaction (bills). It is developed with Ruby on Rails and a little bit of
Preact. Due to limited time _(and interest)_ available, _it is abandoned now_.

But lately, I have been just learning different technologies in order to solve
some of the technical challenges we faced in Naluri.
