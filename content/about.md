Hi, welcome to my blog! I am Kai Wern.

Here I write about software and life. Some of the tools I use daily
are vim, Elixir/Phoenix, Rust, and PostgreSQL. You can expect posts about these from my blog.

Recently, I just finished up my batch in [RC](https://www.recurse.com/). During my time
in RC, I have work on:

- Writing [simple database in Rust](https://github.com/kw7oe/mini-db), inspired by
[Let's Build a Simple Database](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/).
- Writing [`rok`](https://github.com/kw7oe/rok), a minimal reverse proxy inspired by [ngrok](https://ngrok.io).
- Implementing [Viewstamped Replication (VSR) in Elixir](https://github.com/kw7oe/vsr-elixir) based on this
[paper](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf).
- Learning about database and exploring other lower level system like networking, observability and etc.
- Writing a book about building a ~simple~ database in Rust, based on my work
above and inspired by
[Let's Build a Simple Database](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/) and
[Crafting Intepreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

## Now

After my RC batch ended, I’m focusing on the following stuff:

- Getting a job. Currently, I’m applying for different jobs, hoping to be able to pivot my career into working on lower-level systems.
- Continue to work on my projects in RC, such as the database system, VSR implementation, and `rok`.
- Learn more about data structures and algorithms.
- Thinking of starting making video content about programming.
- Start some side hustle so I can have multiple income sources down the road.

## Abandoned Projects

These are the side projects that I worked in the past to learn, which now have been abandoned by me:

- [TIL][1]: Today I learned a web application developed with Phoenix. It includes basic features like adding posts with Markdown and tagging. The idea of the application is inspired by Hashrocket TIL.
- [Expendere][2]: A personal finance management web application that includes features like, expense tracking, budget, and recurring transaction (bills). It is developed with Ruby on Rails and a little bit of Preact. Due to limited time (and interest) available, it is abandoned now.
- [hbtrack][3]: My first CLI to track habits! It’s written in Ruby and still functions well. But I stopped using it, and uss Streaks instead.
