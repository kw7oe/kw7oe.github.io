This is my first attempt to reflect upon a year of my life, writing it down and
publishing it publicly. Hopefully, sometime in the future, this post will
remind my future self how I lived through 2020, _one of the toughest year of
most people life_.

Year 2020, has been great for me. Even though there is a pandemic going on almost half of a year,
things are still good.  I still have a job. I am still healthy. My family, and friends are still
with me, and that’s all that matter.

There are a lot of things I have been through in 2020, which lead to a lot of
learnings and takeaways. I gained more experience of being an adult and also
realize many of my mistakes and weaknesses throughout the year

# The main takeaways
The key takeways of 2020 is:

> Life is fragile.

Seeing how a pandemic impact the human population, just changes my perspective
on life generally. _While life can be fragile, humankind is strong_.

Knowing that, it's important for us to take time and appreciate things we have.
The fact that you are reading this, means you are luckier than a lot of people
around the world. Let's start to be grateful of what we have,

Appreciate what you already have. And don't take it for granted.

# Goals

In the beginning of 2020, I set out to:

- Be a consistent writer.
- Be better and efficient in learning
- Exercise consistently.
- Be good at dating and loving someone.
- Be a better son.

In order to achieve my goals, here are some of the habits I'm building during
2020:

- Writing at least 3 times per week.
- Taking notes after reading books.
- Wake up early and complete my morning routine _(exercise, meditate and read
  books)_ consistently.
- Learning efficiently _(using technique like spaced repetition)_

  So here's a brief review of why and how I am progressing in 2020 for each goals.

### Be a consistent writer

This was my main gaols in 2020, and in order to achieve that, I try to write at
least 3 times per week. But why was this the main goal over everything else?
This ie because:

- It helps me to articulate my thoguhts and to form my opinion on things.
- It helps me to think more critically.
- There is a lots of knowledge I want to share, that would be helpful to
  people. And one way to achieve that is write it down.
- It trains me to structure and simplify my thoughts and mental model about
  things. Through the action of writing down, rereading and rewriting it, it
  allows me to smooth the edges of my thoughts.
- It trains me to communicate and express myself clearly. Especially, when
  writing tutorials, it really challenge me on how I should structure and
  express certain concepts in a simpler way, which helps in understanding the
  material better, thus learning it.

I did quite well in 2020. I published one post per month continuously for 7
months _(from February to August 2020)_. While is not the best, it's something
cherish my life a little bit.

On top of that, every week, I _scheduled a time block to think and reflect_. I
started by scheduling a 10 minutes time block, to just sit down and write down
the thoughts I have in mind.

Sometimes I write about the problems I’m facing, and how would I advise myself
if I am my friend. It’s helpful to have this kind of conversation with ourselves
as it helps us to see things from different perspective. I also find that the act
of  writing my frustration/issues/feelings down helps to calm myself.

Later on, this session become a much more like a planning/thinking session,
where I think about the goals and tiny habits I want to focus on each week.
There are more on these I can write on, but that's all for the reflection for
now _(let's leave that for another post)_.

### Be better and efficient in learning

To me, part of life is continuous learning. Hence, being better and efficient
at learning is another goal I set out to achieve in 2020.

Sometime ago, I learn about spaced repetition from WaniKani, and also read a
book, Make It Stick, that talk about the science of learning. Hence, I decided
to try to incorporate these techniques into my day to day learning.

The result? _I failed badly._ I'm still learning my old way. I still don't
retain much after reading a book.
