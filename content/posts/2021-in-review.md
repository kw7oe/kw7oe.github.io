I thought 2021 will great as usual for me. Turn out it didn't.
Who knows, it haven't really end yet.

Is that too much negativity? Let me rephrase it then.

Half of it is great, the other half of it not so.

Let's focus on the positive side of things and talk about what I have
achieved this year first.

# Achievements

While I perceived my 2021 as not great, in retrospective, I have actually
achieved a couple of great things:

- Consistently publish blog post for 3 months (May, June and July).
- Having a few tweets that reach a lot of people, which lead me to:
  - Getting invited as a guest in an Elixir [Podcast][0]
- Contributed to open source. Here are some of the small contributions I made the past 12 months:
  - https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-erlang/pull/306
  - https://github.com/aws-beam/aws-elixir/pull/102
  - https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/pull/862
  - https://github.com/ex-aws/ex_aws/pull/812
  - https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-erlang/pull/268
  - https://github.com/opentelemetry-beam/opentelemetry-examples/pull/6
- Being vaccinated.
- Completed Nioh 2 up to Dream of the Nioh.
- Still having a job.
- Clean up a couple of technical debts in Naluri.
  - Migrated our Elixir/Phoenix monolith from EC2 instances to ECS.
  - Update our Elixir/Phoenix monolith dependencies to latest and N - 1. _Yes, all
  dependencies, including Elixir and OTP version as well_
  - Update our main PostgreSQL from 9.6 to 13.3, of course with some downtime (around 30 minutes).
- Taking a solo trip to Sabah _(where I started to write this piece)_.
- Being lost in life. _(am still lost)_

Some of the achievements I have, aren't planned out, so
those are really extra wins for me.

Looking back, it's not really as bad as I think it is, but part of me feel
there's so much things I can do better in 2021. Let's talk about those.

# Failures

I failed to meet most the goals I set out to do in 2021.
Yeap, you heard that right. The only goal that I achieved so far is
contribute to open source.

Let's walk through each of my failures.

## Being a consistent writer

Failed to do so because of personal issues. While I manage to be consistent for a few months,
I end up hitting the wall.

It's not because I have ran out of topics to write about. It's just I lost the
"motivation" to write. I became lazy to write. Unmotivated, lazy, whatever it
is.

I might also reason as, I'm burnout and am taking a break for doing anything. I
feel less strongly than before about writing down my learnings.

## Sharing more of what I know

One of my goals in 2021, is to share knowledge more often. Be it writing more
articles, producing screen cast or sharing useful tips in Twitter.

I ended up either doing poorly or not doing at all for all of that. Same as the
failure above, it's not because I have ran out of knowledge to share. It's also
not because I'm pursuing other more interesting meaningful work.

It's just, don't feel like doing it anymore.

## Learning

For learning, I categorized into tech and non tech learning. Failed at both.

I actually started to pick back playing Ukulele and have been learning to play 1 or 2
instrumental finger style music. It went really well initially, I can play
probably the two verses. But shit happen and I stopped.

For learning, I set out to complete [CMU Database System course][1] by the end
of 2021. I listened to a few of the lectures in Youtube and started learning C++.
I even completed up to Chapter 19 of [Programming Principle and Practice using
C++][3]. The next step for me is just attempting [the C++ Primer project of the
course][2]. Then, same shit happen, and I stopped being engaged.

Maybe it's the fear of failure. Maybe, I'm afraid to find out that I'm not
smart enough to work through the project. Maybe. Regardless, that end there.

I have to admit, writing C++ and low level stuff is still hard to me. That
could be part of the factor on why I stopped. It just feels hard to work
through it and I don't have that, determination like before anymore.

While writing all these and referring to my journal, I realized that I actually
finish working through [Learn you some Erlang for great good][4] and are
actually be able to work with Erlang code base more comfortably.

I think that can be explained by, learning Erlang take less mental energy for
me as an Elixir user, but C++ and low level stuff, really requires lots of
patience and mental energy.

Guess, I'm just not in the state where I can learn more challenging stuff in
2021.

## Building Products

I also set out to build interesting product/projects for my own usage in 2021. One
of them is a Firefox Tab manager.

Similar to the stories above, I started well. Spent a day or two to create a
MVP. Following weeks, I polished the UI and added more features that I think should be
there before I release it.

Then, It get abandoned.

This is because I see no value of continuing it as I don't need a tab manager
anymore, which is partly due to me stop writing and don't have the need to
manage multiple tabs _(as references for my writing)_.

This happen to all of my side projects.

1. Get excited about solving some problems I have.
2. Coding coding coding.
3. All of sudden, feel there's no need of that anymore.
4. Abandon.

I have never once in my life, build and maintain a project that is still being
used. Not even once.

Most importantly, the question to ask is, does this matter? Turns out to be:

> No. It doesn't matter that I have never build a project that is still being
> maintained and used.

To me, it's a luxury to be able to achieve that. But, I won't ever be regret in
my life of not being able to do so. I'm more interested in other stuff than
building a great product alone.
