Lately, I have been struggling to accomplish anything I set out to do.

I want to do a lot of things. Yet, I accomplished nothing.

Do you have the similar experience? Are you struggling with this as well?

Let me tell you the single trick I use to get better.

> Focus on one thing at a time.

Sound simple right? But simple is not easy.

# The fallacy of having many goals

I wanted to do a lot of different things, even though I only have
at most 8 hours per day _(excluding work and sleep)_.

Throughout the last few weeks, I'm not feeling satisfied nor proud
of the work that I did. I'm always struggling about: _"What should I do now?"_
whenever I have free time.

My inner self is constantly prioritizing the things that I wanted to do.
So given that scenario guess how's my progress for each goal looks like?

Have you heard of Paradox of Choice? This is a perfect example for that.

When we are having too many goals set out for ourselves,
we have inherently fallen into the prey of having too many choices.

When we have _too many goals, that are equally important, nothing is important._

When nothing is important, every single time, we have to go through the inner
conflict, to decide what's the goal we want to work on that particular day.

We now have more noise, thus, more cognito effort needed to prioritize our goals
_(repeatedly everyday)_,

On top of that, to "feel accomplished", we wanted to work a bit on everything.
When that happen, our attention span, effort are spread across all the goals
we have.

When we set out to have too many goals, it becomes harder to prioritize and
focus on on our goals. Now we have our attention span and effort spread
across all these.

# Why one thing at a time?

First and foremost, by focusing on one thing at a time,
I have less **context switching**.

Less context switch also means I can get into the flow easier, and hence have
a better focus and involvement in the activity as well.

With laser like focus, I get to accomplish my goal earlier as well.

By focusing on one thing at a time, I'm also 100% clear that this is the right
thing to work on. Since, I have done the prioritization with myself when
deciding that what are the one thing I want to focus on.

Once I have completed one thing, I repeat the process of prioritization
and to decide the next _one thing_ I would like to focus on.

# What if I get bored!?

Focusing on doing one thing the whole month is hard.

You might get bored with the tasks on hand easily. You might just want to
switch to work on a different thing.

When that happen, it's important to understand:

> Why do I get bored? Is this still the thing I really wanted to do?
> If so, why do you feel bored?

Take some time, to think about this. It's crucial because it helps us to
understand what we really want. _Know thyself._

There could be a couple of reasons:

- The thing you are focusing on might require intense effort. It's more
  mentally/physically draining where it's not feasible to work on it every
  single day the whole month. This means that you want to balance out your day
  with something less intensive.
- You just can't work on a single thing the whole month. You are so curious of
  everything where you can't stop yourself from feeling curious and wanting to
  get your hands dirty.

Practically, while I advocate you to focus on one thing at a time, the scope of
the application depends on you.

- If focusing on one thing the whole month is hard, start with focusing on one
  thing every week. For example, for each week of the month, spend the whole
  week to write, and another week to build your side project. With this, you
  are probably more likely to complete writing your article and publish it.
- If focusing on one thing the whole week is hard, start with focusing on one
  thing per day. For example, instead of writing the whole week, for Monday,
  Wednesday and Friday, you only aim to spend your time writing. On the other
  days of the week, you can spend your time building your side project. Even
  with this approach, you'll have a better output and not being bored of doing
  the same thing the whole week.
- If focusing on one thing the whole day is hard, start with focusing on one
  thing per hour. For example, every day, you'll probably have around 2-3 hours
  for your personal time. Instead of focusing on writing that day, allocate an
  hour where you focus your time on actually writing.
- If focusing on one thing an hour is hard, start with, stop
  multitasking on whatever you are doing. For example, I always have some
  YouTube video playing my monitor when I work on something _(even at this time
  of writing, I have a YouTube video playing in my monitor)_. One small change
  is to just stop having the YouTube playing and have all my 5 senses focusing
  on the task on hand.

Did you get the idea behind? We are applying the practice at different scope.

I'm scoping it to different time aspect above, but you can also apply
it by category. For example, focusing on only one hobby project at a time
instead of having 2-3 hobby projects, where you end up shipping nothing.

# How to get started?

1. Get a paper and write down all the things that you want to do.
2. Figure out your evaluation criteria for your prioritization. For example,
   happiness, value, knowledge, financial, or a mixed of these. But the simpler
   the better, especially when you just get started.
3. Based on your criteria, choose the top 3 things that ranked the highest.
   That is if your criteria is about happiness, pick the 3 things that bring
   you the most happiness. _(Why 3 things, because I'm assuming you'll probably
   get bored doing the same thing the whole week?)_
4. Scheduled the time blocks to work on the 3 things _throughout your week_.
   Choosing weekly here is because, at this stage, we probably don't need
   ourselves that well yet, and our prioritization might be wrong, so by
   limiting to a week, the worst case is you spend a week of your life to
   try out something that you think is valuable for you but turn out don't.
5. Rinse and repeat from step 1 to 4 every week.

**Other tips and tricks:**

- Ideally, focus on one thing per day. However, if you are the type of person
  that get bored doing a thing a day, at the very least try to focus on one
  thing per hour. This largely depends on the thing that you want to do. For
  example, when I started building the habit of reading, I scheduled a 20
  minutes time block to read every day and it works out well for me. However,
  if I want to learn a new programming language or to build a side project, 20
   minutes is not enough to get me in the zone and get stuff done for real.
- If focusing on a thing per hour is hard, just try to avoid multitasking as
  the very first step. This is what I have been trying out for this week and
  it work pretty well for me. Even sometime I do multitask, the frequency of
  multitasking is reduced.

Here we are focusing on a weekly schedule instead of monthly. Once you get
better and understanding yourself and the process of prioritization, you can
apply the practice on monthly. But it would not be 100% similar to the process
above.
