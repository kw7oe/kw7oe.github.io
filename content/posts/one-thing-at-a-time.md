Lately, I have been struggling to accomplish anything I set out to do.

I want to do a lot of things. Yet, I accomplished nothing.

Do you have the similar experience? Are you struggling with this as well?

Let me tell you the single trick I use to get better.

> Focus on one thing at a time.

# The fallacy of having many goals

Lately, I have been so ambitious that I wanted to do a lot of different
things, even though I only have at most 8 hours per day _(excluding work and
sleep)_.

That's bad. Throughout the last few weeks, I'm not feeling satisfied nor proud
of the work that I did. I'm always struggling about: _"What should I do now?"_
whenever I have free time.

My inner self is constantly reprioritizing the things that I wanted to do. Some
time, A win, while other time, B, C and D win. So given that scenario guess
how's my progress for each goal looks like?

<insert diagram here maybe>

Have you heard of Paradox of Choice? This is a perfect example for that.

When we are having too many goals set out for ourselves,
we have inherently fallen into the prey of having too many choices.

When you have too many goals, that are equally important, nothing is important.
When nothing is important, every single time, you have to go through the inner
conflict, to decide what's the goal you want to work on that particular day.
You have more noise, more cognito effort needed to prioritize your goals
_(repeatedly everyday)_,

On top of that, to "feel accomplished", you wanted to work a bit on everything.
When that happen, your attention span, effort are spread across all the goals
you have.

When you set out to have too many goals, it becomes harder to prioritize and
focus on on your goals. Now you have your attention span and effort spread
across all these.

<might be able to insert chopstick story?>

> The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.


# Why one thing at a time?

First and foremost, by focusing on one thing at a time you have less **context switching**.
You can have laser like focus to accomplish your goal.

Secondly, you are 100%
clear that this are the right things to work on, since you have eliminated all
the other goals that could be the one that you want to focus on.

You get to mark things off earlier, and hence not get distracted now and then
by that particular goal.

You get to reward yourself and feel the win earlier as well.

your goal in a shorter amount of time vs trying to do 3-4 items at once
