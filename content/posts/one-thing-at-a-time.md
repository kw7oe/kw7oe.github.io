Lately, I have been struggling to accomplish anything I set out to do. I wanted
to:

- Wake up at 7:30 am every day.
- Have a consistent morning routine _(workout and meditate)_.
- Publish a post that I have been writing for weeks.
- Learn C++ and Database Systems

I want to do a lot of things. Yet, I accomplished nothing.

Do you have the similar experience? Are you struggling with this as well?

Let me tell you the single trick I use to get better.

> Focus on one thing at a time.

# The fallacy of having many goals

See, I was ambitious and wanting to do ten thousands different things given the
limited time I have per day.

That's bad.

Have you heard of Paradox of Choice? When we are having too many goals set out
for ourselves, we have inherently fallen into the prey of having too many
choices.

When you set out to have too many goals, it becomes harder to prioritize and
focus on on your goals. Now you have your attention span and effort spread
across all these.

```
More goals -> More noise -> More cognitive effort to prioritize -> Less big
chunk of time for focus
```

# Why one thing at a time?

First and foremost, by focusing on one thing at a time you have less **context switching**.
You can have laser like focus to accomplish your goal.

Secondly, you are 100%
clear that this are the right things to work on, since you have eliminated all
the other goals that could be the one that you want to focus on.

You get to mark things off earlier, and hence not get distracted now and then
by that particular goal.

You get to reward yourself and feel the win earlier as well.

```
insert example of how focusing on one can help you finish
your goal in a shorter amount of time vs trying to do 3-4 items at once
```

# What if I get bored!!!!
