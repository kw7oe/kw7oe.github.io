  <article class="prose serif mb-16 text-gray-800">
    <p>I&rsquo;m currently attending a 12 weeks retreats in <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse
Center</a> (RC). Since it&rsquo;s self directed and I&rsquo;m
constantly working at the edge of my abilities, I do face some challenges
during my time here that affect my productivity. Some of the challenges I
faced are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I felt tired/demotivated to do anything after working intensely through a problem.</li>
<li>I felt stupid/self-doubt when things doesn&rsquo;t work as I expected.</li>
<li>I can&rsquo;t seem to mingling around with different projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>After experiencing those, I mostly ended up procrastinating and doom scrolling Twitter
or Youtube. After reflecting about it, these are the solutions I came up with.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Take a 15 minutes break after working through intense problem.</strong></p>
<p>A break will calm your mind down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limit intense focus session to be less than 3 hours.</strong></p>
<p>This force us not to dwell on a problem for too long. I found that after N hours,
continue working on a problem have diminishing returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Write down the things I want to work on.</strong></p>
<p>Often time, we roughly know what to work on, but since we are storing it
mentally in our brain, it takes up capacity and our mental energy.</p>
<p>While this work fine in most of my days, it suffers badly when I&rsquo;m facing
roadblocks during the day. As all my mental energy is sucked by focusing on
the problem. Thus, without writing down ahead, it&rsquo;s unclear for
me what I should be working on next, and I&rsquo;ll have dilemma.</p>
<p>So, by writing things down, we are reducing any friction arises when we
need to move on to our next task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scheduled time block for the things you want to work on.</strong></p>
<p>This strategy is similar to a mixed of the above 2 points. Now that we
have a list of things we want to work on, let&rsquo;s allocate some time blocks for
them, including our break time.</p>
<p>Ideally, to achieve 6 hours of productivity, consider schedule 80%
of your time, which is around 5 hours. The other 20% of your time would be
your buffer.</p>
<p>By scheduling time blocks, we essentially limit the time we focus on, and ensure
we consider break time in our schedule as well. Instead of having a false
hope of &ldquo;we have tons of time&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduce the number of big/intense tasks you are working on.</strong></p>
<p>Once we schedule the time blocks, you&rsquo;ll realize that you have less
time than you think, yet you have so many things you want to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inevitable. Prioritize your list. Pick 3 things from the list, which
you&rsquo;ll schedule dedicated time blocks for. For the rest of the list, think
of it as optional.</p>
<p>I suggest picking 3 things from your lists, but any number is fine as long as
it fits into your hours of productivity you wish to achieve.</p>
<p>Out of the list, I suggest picking:</p>
<ul>
<li>One intense and important thing</li>
<li>One fun thing</li>
<li>One small win</li>
</ul>
<p>Ending your day with small win, is extremely important, especially on the
day where you forsee you&rsquo;ll be having setbacks. This help giving you a
small dose of domaphine from the small win and feel less negativity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
