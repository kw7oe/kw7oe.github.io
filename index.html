    This is a short post about how I build my Elixir/Phoenix releases with Docker and extract the tarball that will be deployed to production. In this approach, we are just building the release with Docker. We are not building the image to run our application in a Docker container.
This post assume that you have the basic knowledge of Docker, building Elixir release and using Elixir 1.

    TLDR: Use Phoenix.Controller.send_download/3 to send binary as download to your users.
 In Phoenix, there are a couple ways of to send file to your users. The most straightforward one is to programmatically create a file and send it to user using Plug.Conn.send_file/5.
For example:
def export(conn, _params) do # Create file filename = &#34;test.

    It is interesting to learn things from scratch. Coming from Ruby background, I was curious what is the equivalent of Sinatra in Elixir. It&rsquo;s called Plug. It is what Phoenix build on top of.
Using Sinatra, we can write a quick and simple web server with the following code:
require &#39;sinatra&#39; require &#39;json&#39; get &#39;/&#39; do content_type :json JSON({message: &#34;Hello World&#34;}) end How can we achive that in Elixir?

    Starting from Elixir 1.4, we don&rsquo;t need to specify our application lists in application. It is automatically inferred from our dependencies. (Check the release notes here)
Do note that it only automatically infer the application lists if the :applications key is empty. If you had already declared your it in your mix.

    Recently, I have been using jekyll to make notes. I use jekyll-compose gem to create post using command line. However, the auto open generated file features isn&rsquo;t working in my machine after the setup.
After a few times on manually opening the generated files in vim, I decided to write a quick shell script to solve this issue.

    Another story about fixing bug. This story is related to the native web API fetch, which is used to make request.
Backstory After serveral days of having my first production application online, my client inform me that, the application has a bug, again. The button was not working as expected for one of the users.

    While I was refactoring the code base of my client application, I came accross a code block, similar to this:
arr = [] data.each do |d| status = d[&#39;status&#39;] next if IGNORED_STATUS.include? status arr &lt;&lt; d[&#39;value&#39;] end I think, &ldquo;Ha, I can replace each with map here.&rdquo;
I go ahead, and make the changes.

    Today, when I am refactoring a CLI I wrote, I came across a code block where I check whether an index exists in an array (turns out I don&rsquo;t actually need it, I can just access the array and check if the value is nil). I went to search of Ruby Array documentation to see if such method exists.

    For the past months, I have started to use vim in some occasions. One day, I came across a vim video, &ldquo;Let Vim Do the Typing&rdquo;{:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}, and discover the use of register in vim. Basically, the concept of register in vim is very similar to the register in our computer. It is a temporary memory space for vim to store text.

    I have been working on a project which uses Vue.js for front end. I came across a scenario where we need to allow user to add more entry in their form.
Initial Approach The first thought that come to my mind will be get the div#id of the element and append it dynamically through javascript

    In Ruby, .() is a syntatic sugar for call method.
class Person def call &#34;Hello World&#34; end end Person.new.() #=&gt; Hello World In this example, we declare a Person class and call method in the class. With this, we can later execute Person.new.() to call the call method.
Note that, we need to initialize the Person object first by calling new, since the call is a instance method.
