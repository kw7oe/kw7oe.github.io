  <p>Lately, I have been struggling to accomplish anything I set out to do.</p>
<p>I want to do a lot of things. Yet, I accomplished nothing.</p>
<p>Do you have the similar experience and struggling as well?</p>
<p>Let me tell you the single trick I use to get better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Focus on one thing at a time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sound simple right? But simple is not easy.</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll cover:</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="the-fallacy-of-having-many-goals">The fallacy of having many goals</h1>
<p>I wanted to do a lot of different things, even though I only have
at most 8 hours per day <em>(excluding work and sleep)</em>.</p>
<p>Throughout the last few weeks, I&rsquo;m not satisfied nor proud
of the work that I did. I&rsquo;m always struggling about: <em>&ldquo;What should I do now?&quot;</em>
whenever I have free time.</p>
<p>My inner self is constantly prioritizing the things that I wanted to do.</p>
<p>So given that scenario guess how&rsquo;s my progress for each goal looks like?</p>
<p>Not great. My focus and time is distributed across different things and I ended up
not feeling satisfied with my output.</p>
<h1 id="paradox-of-choice">Paradox of Choice</h1>
<p>Have you heard of Paradox of Choice? This is a perfect example for that.</p>
<p>When we have too many goals set out for ourselves,
we have inherently fallen into the prey of having too many choices.</p>
<p>When we have <em>too many goals, that are equally important, nothing is important.</em></p>
<p>When nothing is important, every single time, we have to go through the inner
conflict, to decide what we want to work on that particular day.</p>
<p>We also have more noise, which required more cognitive effort to prioritize our goals everyday.</p>
<p>To make things worse, to &ldquo;feel accomplished&rdquo;, we try to work a bit on everything.</p>
<p>When that happen, our attention span and effort are spread across all the goals
we have. Remember the saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, having too many goals make it harder for us to prioritize and
focus on on our goals.</p>
<h1 id="elimination-of-choice">Elimination of Choice</h1>
<p>When that happen, we need to start to say no to ourselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; the answer to all future distractions is “no” until you finish what you started. It’s saying yes to one thing, and no to absolutely everything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Derek Sivers sum it up pretty well in his <a href="https://sive.rs/no2">article</a>, &ldquo;Saying no to
everything else&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When we are overloaded by all the possibilities we have in our life, and we
can&rsquo;t decide, it&rsquo;s time for us to stop deciding. One last decision we need to
make is just pick the <em>one thing</em> that:</p>
<ul>
<li>excite you the most, <em>or</em></li>
<li>you&rsquo;ll feel the most regret if you didn&rsquo;t do it</li>
</ul>
<p>And start focusing on doing that one thing.</p>
<h1 id="why-one-thing-at-a-time">Why one thing at a time?</h1>
<p>First and foremost, by focusing on one thing at a time, I have less <strong>context switching</strong>.</p>
<p>I can get into the flow easier, and hence have a better focus in the activity.
With laser like focus, I get to accomplish my goal earlier as well.</p>
<p>By focusing on one thing at a time, I&rsquo;m also 100% clear that this is the right
thing to work on. Since, I have done the prioritization with myself when
deciding the one thing I want to focus on.</p>
<p>Once I have completed the one thing, I repeat the process of prioritization
to decide the next <em>one thing</em> I would like to focus on.</p>
<p>To sum up, by working on one thing at a time:</p>
<ul>
<li>I prioritize my goals ahead. Hence, no more time spent every day to decide
what I want to do.</li>
<li>I have less context switch. I focus on one thing every single day.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-if-i-get-bored">What if I get bored!?</h1>
<p>Focusing on doing one thing the whole month is hard.</p>
<p>You might get bored with the tasks on hand easily. You might just want to
switch to work on a different thing.</p>
<p>When that happen, it&rsquo;s important to understand the why.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do I get bored? Is this still the thing I really wanted to do?
If so, why do I feel bored?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take some time, to think about it. It&rsquo;s crucial because it helps us to
understand what we really want. <em>Know thyself</em>, they said.</p>
<p>There could be a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The thing you are focusing on require intense effort. It&rsquo;s more
mentally/physically draining. Hence, it&rsquo;s not feasible to work on it every
day the whole month. For such scenario, you want to balance out your day
with something less intensive.</li>
<li>You just can&rsquo;t work on a single thing the whole month. You are so curious
about
everything where you can&rsquo;t stop yourself to
get your hands dirty.</li>
</ul>
<p>Practically, while I advocate you to focus on one thing at a time, you can
apply it differently according to your context.</p>
<ul>
<li>If focusing on one thing the whole month is hard, start with focusing on one
thing every week.</li>
<li>If focusing on one thing the whole week is hard, start with focusing on one
thing per day.</li>
<li>If focusing on one thing the whole day is hard, start with focusing on one
thing per hour.</li>
<li>If focusing on one thing an hour is hard, start with, <strong>stop
multitasking on whatever you are doing</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each week of the month, spend a week to write, and another to build your side project.</li>
<li>Instead of writing the whole week, you spend your time writing on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  On the other days, you spend your time building your side project.</li>
<li>Instead of focusing on writing for a day, allocate an hour where you focus your time on writing.</li>
<li>I always have some YouTube video playing in my monitor when I work
on something <em>(even at this time of writing, I have a YouTube video playing in my monitor)</em>.
One small change is to just stop having the YouTube video playing and focus
on a single task at hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you get the idea behind?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scoping it to different time aspect above, but you can also apply
it by category. For example, focusing on only one hobby project at a time
instead of having 2-3 hobby projects, where you end up shipping nothing.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-get-started">How to get started?</h1>
<p>A straightforward way to get started is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to say no to everything and say yes to the one and only thing that excite you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as mentioned in <a href="#elimination-of-choice">&ldquo;Elimination of Choice&rdquo;</a> section.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s hard to do the above, here&rsquo;s a more structural approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a paper and write down all the things that you want to do.</li>
<li>Figure out your evaluation criteria for your prioritization. For example,
happiness, value, knowledge, financial, or a mixed of these. But the simpler
the better, especially when you just get started.</li>
<li>Based on your criteria, choose the top 2-3 things that ranked the highest.
That is if your criteria is about happiness, pick the 2-3 things that bring
you the most happiness. <em>(Why 3 things, because I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;ll probably
get bored doing the same thing the whole week)</em></li>
<li>Scheduled the time blocks to work on the 2-3 things <em><strong>throughout your week</strong></em>.
We choose weekly here because, at this stage, we probably don&rsquo;t know
ourselves that well and our prioritization might be wrong, so by
limiting to a week, the worst case is you spend a week of your life to
try out something that you think is valuable for you but turn out not to be
valuable as you thought.</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat from step 1 to 4 <strong>every week</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Other tips and tricks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ideally, focus on one thing per day. However, if you are the type of person
that get bored doing a thing a day, at the very least try to focus on one
thing per hour. This largely depends on the thing that you want to do. For
example, when I started building the habit of reading, I scheduled a 20
minutes time block to read every day and it works out well for me. However,
if I want to learn a new programming language or to build a side project, 20
minutes is not enough to get me in the zone and get stuff done.</li>
<li>If focusing on a thing per hour is hard, just try to avoid multitasking as
the very first step. This is what I have been trying out for this week and
it work pretty well for me. Even sometime I do multitask, the frequency of
multitasking is reduced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we are focusing on a weekly schedule instead of monthly. Once you get
better and understanding yourself and the process of prioritization, you can
apply the practice on monthly. But it would not be 100% similar to the process
above.</p>
<h1 id="closing">Closing</h1>
<p>Does this mean I have figure it all out? Hell no. It&rsquo;s a simple trick, but also a hard one to stick with. It takes practice and reflection over and over again until you find the process that work for you. <strong>Give it a try. Who know what it will lead to?</strong></p>
<p>Imagine how your world will
become, if you just stop multitasking <em>(on things that shouldn&rsquo;t be
multitask)</em>.</p>
