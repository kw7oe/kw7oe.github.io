        <p>
         I am a generalist trying to dive deeper. I have experience in web development, performance improvement, and infrastructure. Currently, I want to work on lower-level systems such as storage, network, and observability. I can have 5 working hours overlap with Pacific Time, from 1 pm to 6 pm Pacific Time, which is equivalent to 5 am to 10 am GMT+8.

        <p class="italic" style="font-size: 0.85rem">July 2020 to Present</p>

        <ul class="disc">
          <li>
            Improved security, reliability, and scalability of our
            infrastructure by replacing manual deployment to AWS EC2 with
            continuous deployment with GitOps to AWS ECS with Terraform and
            GitHub Action.  This standardized deployment process enabled secure
            credentials and access management, version control on application configuration, and ease of setting up new services by engineers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduced duration for mobile app builds and releases by building an automated pipeline with GitHub Action. This frees up engineering resources to focus on more impactful works.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved resource utilization and prevented an incident by reducing the read IOPS of PostgreSQL RDS instance on time, by ~77%, from 2600 IOPS to 600 IOPS. Fixed by writing a more efficient SQL query.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved reliability and reduced the operational burden of our core
            service by fixing a memory leak. Without intervention, the
            issue will crash the service after a short period of time. Fixed by
            rewriting a query and resulted in a ~66% reduction of the service's average memory usage from 1.5GB to 0.5GB.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide mentoring to the members of the Engineering, Product, and Data team. I help people navigate their challenges by having one on one and pairing session with them to guide them through their problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Interviewed junior and senior candidates to evaluate their behavioral and technical aspects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Part of engineering leads that discussed cultural and technical issues and suggested initiatives.
          </li>
          <li>
            Acted as the person in charge of Vulnerability Assessment and
            Penetration Testing (VAPT) to provide any assistance needed by our
            vendor and led the team to fix several security findings. This helped secure multiple contracts with our business clients.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="disc">
          <li>
            Designed a better payment experience by migrating Naluri's payment provider from SenangPay to Stripe to support multiple currencies and flexibility for different billing packages. Built using Elixir.
          </li>
          
          
          
          
          <li>
            Created competitive advantage for the business by developed steps tracking feature on time as the main selling point to clients.  Used React Native and TypeScript, and deployed to AWS EC2 setup with Pulumi and Ansible.
          </li>
          
          
          
          
          
          
          <li>
             Improved operational efficiency and enabled customization of users' experience by enhancing our coach assignment systems to support rule-based coach assignments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved users' experience of Naluri applications by improving the performance of slow queries in the hot path by adding indexes and removing N + 1 queries.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved resource utilization and reliability of background jobs by reducing memory usage of a job that frequently crashed our instance. Fixed by optimizing the code to reduce memory usage by ~46%, from 11.40 GB to 6.06 GB.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved the process of the Operation team by setting up technical support workflow in Slack and writing scripts to execute bulk changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Increased confidence in software delivery by introducing unit and integration testing to several backend services written in Elixir and TypeScript.
