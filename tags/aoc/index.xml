      <description>In the previous post, we had briefly discuss about the solution of Part 1. It is fairly straightforward. I thought Part 2 is going to be easy too. But man, I was wrong. It is a bit tricky.
My initial solution takes around 17 seconds to compute the answer. I made it 34x faster by changing the data structure.</description>

      <description>Advent of Code (AOC) 2018 has finally arrived. This is the first time I participate in AOC. Last year, when I first heard of AOC, I wanted to participate in it. But due to heavy workload from university, I just give up on doing it.
This year, it&amp;rsquo;s different, I had graduated and working remotely.</description>
