      <description>In my previous post &amp;ldquo;Building Elixir/Phoenix Release With Docker&amp;rdquo;, I wrote about how I build Elixir release with Docker and extract the tarball. Today, I am going to share how I deploy Elixir release to the production server.
Do note that, the way I deploy works best for hobby or small projects.</description>

      <description>This is a short post about how I build my Elixir/Phoenix releases with Docker and extract the tarball that will be deployed to production. In this approach, we are just building the release with Docker. We are not building the image to run our application in a Docker container.</description>
