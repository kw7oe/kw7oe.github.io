      <description>For the past 6 weeks, I have been attending the Recurse Center (RC). The Recurse Center is:
 an educational retreat for programmers who want to become dramatically better with a community of peers doing the same.
 The journey has been fascinating. Hence, I want to share my experience and challenges in RC so far and plan for my remaining 6 weeks in RC.</description>
